# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecast-of-the-Sedimentary-Deposits
This project is to forecast the thickness of the sedimentary deposits. The data set records the thickness of the sedimentary deposits each year over a period of 624 years at one particular location. By data transformation, model selection and model adequacy check, I built an ARIMA model to predict the thickness of the sedimentary deposits in R. Since different temperatures lead to different levels of melt, which, of course, affect the variation in the thickness of the sedimentary deposits. Thus, looking at these layers of silt and sediment can give an indication of the temperature changes from one year to the next.
